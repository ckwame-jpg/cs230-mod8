# Draw It or Lose It – Software Design Documentation

## Project Overview

This project was developed for The Gaming Room, a client that wanted to expand their Android game, “Draw It or Lose It,” into a web-based application that works across multiple platforms. As a Technology Consultant at CTS, my job was to create a scalable, flexible, and secure software design to support this transition. The game needed to allow multiple teams and players, ensure unique names, and maintain a single instance using a Singleton pattern.

**Client & Requirements**  
The Gaming Room wanted a cross-platform web version of their game “Draw It or Lose It.” Their main requirements included:  
- Multiple teams and players  
- Unique game and team names  
- A Singleton design pattern to ensure only one game instance in memory  
- Web-based functionality that works on various devices  

**What I Did Well**  
I focused on creating a clean and flexible design that’s easy to maintain and scale. The architecture allows for future features like user profiles or moderator roles without needing to rewrite the whole system. The use of clear OOP principles and a solid domain model helped keep things organized and easy to understand.

**Helpful Process Insight**  
Writing the design document before touching any code forced me to think through how everything fits together. It helped me identify potential issues early—like performance on mobile or handling real-time multiplayer—and come up with solutions in advance.

**What I’d Revise**  
I’d expand the system architecture section with diagrams and more detail. While it wasn’t required, it would make the design easier to follow for future devs and help communicate how the pieces connect at a higher level.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**  
The client’s needs drove every major design decision. I made sure the system handled team structure, naming rules, and future scalability. Designing from the user’s perspective ensures the app solves the right problems without unnecessary complexity.

**Design Techniques Going Forward**  
I plan to continue using UML diagrams, requirement analysis, and platform evaluation. In the future, I’d also add wireframes or early UI mockups to help bridge the gap between the technical side and the user experience.
